# Clustering-Analysis
This project analyzes clustering algorithms on synthetic and real-world data, offering insights into their performance. Using K-means and hierarchical methods, we evaluate cluster quality with internal and external metrics. Visualizations highlight algorithm strengths and limitations, aiding data-driven decision-making.
